    CEIC API

    CEIC API v2 is a new generation RESTful API that provides an easy access to CEIC's analytical and time series information, including all metadata items and time point values. It includes powerful keyword and criteria search, as well as a data feed option – retrieving only the newest time points data, in order to feed user’s own database and compare the actual changes introduced. Supported output formats include XML, JSON and CSV.  API access is secured utilizing API keys and all data transfer encrypted via HTTPS. In order to use any of the API functions, users shall generate such a key. This can be done through user's profile menu under CDMNext. Users can have only one active API key. Generating a new key will invalidate the existing one. API keys have to be included with each HTTP request, either as an `Authorization` header or as `token` query parameter.  All dates for both input parameters and output attributes are in ISO 8601 format (YYYYMMDD or YYYY-MM-DD) in order to avoid misinterpretation of numeric representations of dates and times, particularly when data are transferred between countries with different conventions for writing numeric dates and times.  <p style=\"color: red\">Security Notice: As of June 30, 2018 the CEIC API v2 will not be accessible by clients using SSL or TLS 1.0 security protocol</p>  <ul>         <li>             <a href='https://developer.isimarkets.com/en/docs/ceic/macroeconomic/python/full-guide'>CEIC Python SDK - Development Guide</a>         </li>         <li>             <a href='https://developer.isimarkets.com/en/docs/ceic/macroeconomic/php/full-guide'>CEIC PHP SDK - Development Guide</a>         </li>         <li>             <a href='https://developer.isimarkets.com/en/docs/ceic/macroeconomic/js/full-guide'>CEIC JavaScript SDK - Development Guide</a>         </li>     <li>   <a href='https://downloads.ceicdata.com/api/documentation/api-release-notes.html'>Release Notes</a>   <span>             <a href=\"https://downloads.ceicdata.com/api/documentation/api-release-notes-rss.xml\">                 <img src=\"https://downloads.ceicdata.com/api/documentation/release-notes-files/rss-logo-rectangle-35x75.png\">             </a>         </span>     </li>  </ul>  <div>     <a href='https://api-status.ceicdata.com/'>Monitor CEIC API Status</a> </div>  # noqa: E501
